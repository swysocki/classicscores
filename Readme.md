## FAQ

- Why does ClassicScores.com exist?

Competitive paintball has been played since the 80's, but the results were recorded in magazines and other print distributions. ClassicScores attempts to create a consolidated, digital record of paintball's rich, competitive heritage.

- Why not use a database? 

Accessiblity and longevity. Although it would be more convenient and allow me to add more features, ClassicScores' data will be stored in non-binary format.  This means that search engines can copy it directly, it can be directly archived, and anyone can directly download a copy. 

- How do I contribute?
