## FAQ

- Why does ClassicScores.com exist?

Competitive paintball has been played since the 80's, but the results were recorded in magazines, print distributions and websites that are long gone. ClassicScores attempts to create a consolidated, digital record of paintball's rich, competitive heritage.

- Why not use a database? 

Accessiblity and longevity. Although it would be more convenient and allow me to add more features, ClassicScores' data will be stored in non-binary format.  This means that search engines can copy it directly, it can be directly archived, and anyone can directly download a copy.
